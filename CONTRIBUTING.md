## Code style
- Use tabs.
- Use signle quotes `'` and not double quotes `"`.
- If you have to use some sort of string formating use f-strings.
- Don't put unneccesary comments.
- Follow the PEP8 guidelines, ex. two empty lines between methods.
- Ask is supposed to be in a single python script i.e. `ask.py`.
- A transpiled Ask program `app.py` should be able to run completely standalone. So all neccesary function, classes, utilities, etc. needs to be added to the transpiled code. This means no local module importing.
