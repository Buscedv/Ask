# Ask

<!-- [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/circleci-docs.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Buscedv/Ask) -->

## Introduction
Ask is an open source, dynamic, and transpiled programming language built for building backends and APIs. Ask directly transpiles to Python, more specifically Flask.

### Feature Highlights
- Built-in JWT Authentication.
- Super Simple Database Management.
- Syntax Inspired by Python.
- Built-in CORS Support.
- Reduces Boilerplate.
- Compatible with Python*

`* = You can import external Python modules and call them from you Ask code.`

## Easy to Learn
Ask's syntax is heavily inspired by Python, and can almost be considered to be a superset of Python. This means that picking up Ask is super easy if youâ€™re already familiar with Python.

The main idea behind Ask is to simplify common backend actions (e.g. working with databases). Building a full database CRUD REST API with JWT authentication in Ask is very straight forward and simple and requires virtually zero lines of boilerplate code and no setup whatsoever.

## Extendable
Ask is a transpiled language (kind of like TypeScript) which means that it compiles the source code to another language that has a similar level of abstraction. In Ask's case, the target language is Python, more specifically a Flask app.

Flask is a very popular and well-established web framework for Python, so there's already a lot of tools, and services for deploying Flask apps.

The transpiled app is completely standalone and doesn't require Ask in any way.

## Installation (normal usage)
- You can install Ask from the PyPI. You can use `pip` but we recommend that you use [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/).
- `$ pipx install ask-lang`.
- Then run your apps with: `$ ask [your file].ask`.

## Run locally (for development)
1. Clone this repo: `https://github.com/Buscedv/Ask.git`.
2. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
3. Create a new virtual environment: `python3 venv venv`.
4. Activate it: `source venv/bin/activate`.
5. Install dependencies: `poetry install`.
6. (Optional but helpful in some cases) Run Ask in development mode: [Docs](https://docs.ask.edvard.dev/development-tools/running-in-development-mode1).

If you want to contribute please read the CONTRIBUTING.md file for code style, standards, etc.

## Example (Ask vs Flask)
Here is the same basic app with one GET route written in Ask and in Python with Flask.

### Ask
```python
products = [
  {
    name: 'Product 1',
    price: 30.0,
    qty: 300
  },
  {
    name: 'Product 2',
    price: 15.5,
    qty: 20
  }
]

@get('/api/v1/products'):
  respond({products: products})
```

### Flask
This is what the same application would look like in Flask.

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

products = [
  {
    'name': 'Product 1',
    'price': 30.0,
    'qty': 300
  },
  {
    'name': 'Product 2',
    'price': 15.5,
    'qty': 20
  }
]

@app.route('/api/v1/products', methods=['GET'])
def get_products():
  return jsonify({'products': products})

if __name__ == '__main__':
  app.run()
```

As you can see Ask hides away all the clutter and boilerplate.
